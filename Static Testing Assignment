*****1.Explain about Coding Standards*****
     Coding standards are a set of guidelines and best practices that developers follow while writing code.
They ensure that code is consistent, readable, maintainable, and error-free across a team or organization.  
Key Points:
1. Consistency
2. Readability
3. Maintainability  
4. Error Reduction
5. Team Collaboration 
6. Reusability
*****2.Benefits of Static Testin:*****
1. Early Defect Detection: 
    ==>Finds errors in requirements, design, or code before execution.  
2. Cost-Effective: 
    ==>Cheaper to fix defects early than during dynamic testing.  
3. Improves Quality:
    ==>Ensures coding standards and documentation are followed.  
4. Prevents Critical Errors: 
    ==>Catches syntax, logic, and security issues early.  
5. Saves Time: 
    ==>Reduces defects during actual testing, making testing faster.
