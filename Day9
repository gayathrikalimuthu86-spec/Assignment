****1. Explain the Advantages of Agile over Waterfall Model.****
1. Flexibility and Adaptability
--> Agile: Allows changes at any stage based on feedback or requirement changes.
--> Waterfall: Difficult to make changes once a phase is completed.
2. Customer Involvement
--> Agile: Customers are involved throughout the development process.
--> Waterfall: Customer feedback is taken only after the final product is delivered.
3. Faster Delivery
--> Agile: Delivers working software in small increments (sprints), allowing early use.
--> Waterfall: Entire product is delivered at the end.
4. Better Risk Management
--> Agile: Regular testing and review reduce the chance of large failures.
-->Waterfall: Risks are identified late, usually at testing or deployment.
5. Improved Quality
-->Agile: Continuous integration and testing improve quality.
--> Waterfall: Testing happens only after development is complete.
6. Team Collaboration
--> Agile: Emphasizes teamwork, communication, and daily meetings.
--> Waterfall: More formal and less collaborative.

****2. Difference between SDLC and STLC****
==>SDLC defines the overall process of developing software. 
==>Focuses on requirement gathering, design, coding, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
==>Involves developers, analysts, testers, and stakeholders.
==>Covers the complete software project lifecycle.
==>Starts from requirement phase and ends with deployment and maintenance.
==>STLC defines the process of testing the software. 
==>Focuses on test planning, test case design, test execution, defect reporting, and closure. 
==>Involves only testing team. 
==>Covers only the testing phase in detail. 
==>Starts from test requirement analysis and ends with test closure. 

***3. What is a Sprint in Agile? What is Scrum meeting?***
What is a sprint in Agile?
     In Agile, a Sprint is a short, fixed period of time (usually 1 to 4 weeks) during which a team works 
to complete a specific set of tasks or features from the project backlog.
Key points:
--> Each Sprint has a clear goal and deliverable.
--> It starts with a Sprint Planning meeting and ends with a Sprint Review and Retrospective.
--> The outcome of a Sprint is a potentially shippable product increment.
--> Helps teams deliver working software frequently.
What is a scrum meeting?
   A Scrum Meeting (also called a Daily Stand-up) is a short, time-boxed meeting (usually 15 minutes) 
held every day in Agile Scrum teams.
   To help the team stay on track, identify blockers, and plan the day’s work.
Benefits:
- Keeps everyone aligned  
- Promotes communication  
- Quickly identifies issues  

****4. Explain about Kanban Board.****
     A Kanban Board is a visual tool used in Agile project management to track and manage work as 
it moves through a process.
Benefits:
--> Clear view of task status  
--> Helps avoid overloading team members  
--> Easy tracking and collaboration
Key Features:
    --> Divides work into columns like:
    --> To Do
    --> In Progress
    --> Testing
    --> Done
    --> Each task is represented by a card that moves across the board from left to right.
****5. What is V-model****
     V-Model (Verification and Validation Model) is a software development model 
where each development stage is directly associated with a testing phase. It is also known as the Validation and Verification model.
    ==>Left Side – Development Phases (Verification)
    ==>Right Side – Testing Phases (Validation)
