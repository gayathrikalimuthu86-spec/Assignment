1. Equivalence Paritioning:
      Divide the input domain: Identify the different sets of inputs based on the software's
requirements. These sets are divided into partitions of equivalent data, which are often
categorized as either valid or invalid.

•Create test cases: 
      Choose one representative value from each of these partitions to create a
single test case.

Example 1: Login Page – Password Length
Requirement: Password must be 8–16 characters long.
Invalid (less than 8):"abc123"	Reject
Valid (8–16):"abc12345"	Accept
Invalid (more than 16):"abcdefghijklmnopq"	Reject.

2.  Boundary Value Analysis:
     Boundary value analysis is a software testing technique that focuses on testing the limits of input
ranges, such as the minimum and maximum values, because errors are often found at these
boundaries.

Test Case ID: TC_EP_001
Test Case Title: Validate the “Age” input field using Equivalence Partitioning
Test Description: Verify that the system accepts valid age values (18–60) and rejects invalid ones.
Precondition:	User is on the registration page with the “Age” field visible
Input Data (Equivalence Partitions): 10 (Invalid – below range)
                                     25 (Valid – within range)
                                     70 (Invalid – above range)
Test Steps:	1. Enter the given age value in the “Age” field.
            2. Click on the “Submit” button.
Expected Result:System should show an error for age below 18.
