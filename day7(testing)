***1.IMPORTANCE OF TESTING AND EXAMPLES***
  1.Ensure Quality:
     Testing helps deliveer a bug-free and smooth-working product.

  2.Prevents Failure:
     It helps identify and fix errors before ysers face problems.

  3.Improves User Experience:
     A well-tested app/software works as expected and keeps users satisfied.

  4.Saves Time and Money
       Finding bugs early is cheaper than fixing them afterr release.

  5.Built Trust
       Reliable software gains customer trust and a good reputation.

    Examples:
        *Bank application(To avoid financial errors and ensure correct calculated and transactions)
          -->A user trnsfer Rs.1000,but Rs.2000 gets debited.

       *Online shopping App(To prevent order mismatches and ensure the systemdelibers the right product)
          --> A user orders a blue shirts but receives a red one
      *Login System:(To ensure security and protect ysr data fromunauthoried access.)
          -->A user enters the wrong password but still gets loogged in.

***2.Difference between Quality assurance and Quality control***

      QUALITY ASSURANCE:(Preventing problems)
            -->Process-oriented.
            -->To prevent defects by improving development processes.
            -->Proactive(before  product is built)
            -->Reviewing documents,conducting audis,following sstandards.

      QUALITY CONTROL:(Finding problems)
            -->Product oriented.
            -->To identify defects in the final product.
            -->reactive(after product is built).
            -->Manual testing,running test cases,finding bugs.

    Where QA is applicable?(Before and during development)
         1. Before Development Begins  
            --> During planning and designing phases  
            --> Example: Writing test plans, defining coding standards, setting processes

        2. During Development Process  
            --> Ensuring developers follow the correct process  
            --> Code reviews, process audits

       3. Documentation & Process Check  
           --> Ensuring that SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) processes are followed properly

  Wher QC is applicable?(After development,when the product is tested)
        1. After Development (Testing Phase)  
           --> Manual testing, automation testing  
           --> Example: Finding bugs, verifying UI, checking functionality

       2. During Product Verification  
           --> Checking if the actual product meets the requirement

       3. Before Release  
           --> Final round of testing before delivering to the 

    ***What is a Software Defect?***
        A software defect (also called a bug) is a mistake or flaw in a software program that causes it to 
    behave incorrectly or produce the wrong results.
             Types of Defects:
                  1. Functional Defect – When the feature doesn’t work as required  
                  2. Performance Defect – When software is slow or crashes  
                  3. UI Defect – Alignment or display issues  
                  4. Security Defect – Data is not protected properly  
        ****Write a template for Test case.****
            

              **Test Case ID: TC_001  
              **Module Name: Login Page  
              **Test Case Title: Verify login with valid credentials  
              **Test Designed By: [Your Name]  
              **Test Designed Date: [DD-MM-YYYY]  
              **Preconditions: User must be registered  
         Test Data:  
           --> Username: validUser  
           --> Password: validPass123  

        Steps to Execute:
           1. Open the login page  
           2. Enter valid username  
           3. Enter valid password  
           4. Click on the login button  

       Expected Result:  
           User should be redirected to the homepage.
       Actual Result:  
            filled after testing
       Status:  
           Pass / Fail
      Remarks:  
****Explain STLC.****
  
1. Requirement Analysis  
   - Understand the software requirements.  
   - Identify what is testable and clarify doubts with stakeholders.

2. Test Planning  
   - Create a test plan.  
   - Define scope, objectives, resources, schedule, and types of testing to be done.

3. Test Case Design (Test Case Development)  
   - Write test cases and test scripts.  
   - Prepare test data.

4. Test Environment Setup  
   - Prepare hardware and software for testing.  
   - Configure necessary tools and environments.

5. Test Execution  
   - Execute test cases on the application.  
   - Log defects if any mismatches occur.

6. Defect Reporting and Tracking  
   - Report bugs to the development team.  
   - Track their status (Open, Fixed, Re-tested, Closed).

7. Test Cycle Closure  
   - Ensure all planned tests are executed.  
   - Prepare test summary report.  
   - Analyze lessons learned and improve process.
