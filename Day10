****1. Difference between Blackbox and Whitebox Testing.****
Block box:
  ==> Functionality of the application  
  ==> No access to source code
  ==> Requirements and specifications  
  ==> Functional testing, system testing, acceptance 
  ==> Testers or QA  
White box:
  ==> Internal code and logic of the application  
  ==> Full access to source code   
  ==> Code, logic, and internal structure   
  ==> Unit testing, integration testing  
  ==>Developers or technically skilled testers  

****2. What is Non-Functional Testing? Give some examples.****
     Non-Functional Testing is a type of software testing that focuses on how the system performs rather than 
what it does. It checks the quality attributes of an application like speed, scalability, usability, and reliability.
 Example:
    1. Performance Testing(Checks how fast the system responds under load.)
    2. Load Testing(Measures the systemâ€™s behavior under expected user load.)
    3. Security Testing(Identifies vulnerabilities and protects data from threats.)

*****3. Explain the significance of Integration Testing.*****
     Integration Testing is an important level of software testing that checks how different modules or components of an application
work together.
Significance of Integration Testing:
1. Detects Interface Issues Early:  
   ==>It helps identify problems in how modules interactâ€”like data mismatch, incorrect API usage, or communication failures.
2. Improves Data Flow Accuracy:  
   ==>Ensures that data is correctly passed between modules, reducing the chances of bugs during actual user operations.
3. Ensures Smooth System Functionality:  
   ==>By testing the combined modules, we confirm that they function well together, just like they would in the real environment.


****4. If a user tests a site in Chrome browser and he checks the same site in iPhone 6 and finds defects in iPhone 6. Which type of testing is this? Explain.****
   ==>This type of testing is called Compatibility Testing.
   ==>Compatibility Testing checks whether the software or website works as expected across different devices, browsers, operating systems, screen sizes, etc.
   ==>The user tested the site on Chrome browser (probably on desktop or Android).
   ==>Then tested it on iPhone 6 and found some defects.
   ==>This shows that the website is not fully compatible with the iPhone 6 or Safari browser, which is a compatibility issue.


****5. Define Accessibility Testing and its importance.****
Accessibility Testing is a type of software testing used to ensure that an application or website is usable by people with disabilities such as:
   --> Visual impairments (blindness, color blindness)
   --> Hearing impairments
   --> Cognitive disabilities
   --> Motor or physical disabilities
Importance:
    ==>Inclusivity
    ==>Legal Compliance-WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 
    ==>Improved Usability
    ==>Better reach.
